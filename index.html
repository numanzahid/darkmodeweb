                <h1>Dark Mode Web Respecting prefers-color-scheme and switch</h1>
                <p>This code was inspired by <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.blog/">stackoverflow.blog</a>. I started with the same setting as it was on stackoverflow blog but ended up changing a lot that I decided to upload it to public repository. There are some features that I would like you to know</p>
                <p>Unlike all the other solutions available online, this code is written keeping the dark color scheme as first priority.</p>
                <h2>prefers-color-scheme</h2>
                <p>By default the code respects the <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> as defined by visitor's browser. more about <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme">Mozilla's Website</a>.</p>
                <p>My main purpose of changes to the original code was to favor the dark mode. So the website will be designed in dark mode first and it will prefer dark mode except when visitor's browser is set to light.</p>
                <p>If user browser does not support <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> or it is set to <code>no-preference</code>, website will be shown in dark theme.</p>
                <p>If user browser is set <code>prefers-color-scheme : light</code> then website will be shown in light theme.</p>
                <h2>Color Scheme Switch</h2>
                <p>Switch can be added to the website anywhere you like. It is an icon in the example page. But it can be changed to anything.</p>
                <p>Switch allows visitor to change the color scheme. It will override the default behaviour.</p>
                <p>If visitor has used the switch to change the color scheme, the new preference will be saved in browser, and it will always override default <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> behavior.</p>
                <h2>Sync Color Between Browser Tabs</h2>
                <p>If user has used switch to change the color scheme in one tab and there are other tabs open of the same websitie, all the other tabs will have same color scheme. this synchronises the color scheme in all open tabs.</p>
                <h2>How to use:</h2>
                <p>Usage is very simple. you just have to include the js file (can only be js code) in you page.</p>
                <p>Define css variables under the <code>root</code> or <code>body</code>. Keep in mind, these are used for dark mode.</p>
                <p>Override css variables for the light mode under the class <code>.web-light</code>.</p>
                <p>That is it.</p>
                <h2>How it works?</h2>
                <p>The code will add <code>.web-dark</code> or <code>.web-light</code> class to the body on page load.</p>
                <p>If user has switched color scheme using the theme switcher, body will additionally contain <code>.light-forced</code> or <code>.dark-forced</code> according to the theme.</p>
                <P>These additional classes will allow you to modify the color scheme if you want something different for forced color scheme.</P>
